#' Sharp Ration General-purpose optimization
#'
#' The Sharpe ratio (also known as the Sharpe index, the Sharpe measure, and the reward-to-variability ratio) is a way to examine the performance of an investment by adjusting for its risk.
#' The ratio measures the excess return (or risk premium) per unit of deviation in an investment asset or a trading strategy, typically referred to as risk, named after William F. Sharpe.
#' Sharp ration function is optimized by general-purpose optimization based on Nelderâ€“Mead, quasi-Newton and conjugate-gradient algorithms. It includes an option for box-constrained optimization and simulated annealing.
#' @param returns A matrix or data.frame. Returns on stocks
#' @param riskFreeRate An integer, the risk-free rate of return is the theoretical rate of return of an investment with zero risk.
